Bicycle counter is a device that automatically counts cyclists riding on the road. Roadside counting devices for riding cyclists are installed in many cities, also in Krakow. They are usually part of the broader strategy of the city, wanting to encourage its residents to ride bicycles. The bicycle counter usually works on the principle of induction loops embedded in a nearby bicycle path that detect passing bikes. Sometimes photocells are also used to count cyclists. However, the scope of this work is to create visual bicycle counters, based on techniques for recognizing images from publicly available webcams. These data should be counted over a longer time horizon, and, optimally, be combined with data on cards from automatic, urban cycling measurement points (http://mobilnykrakow.pl/rowery/#otwarte-dane).

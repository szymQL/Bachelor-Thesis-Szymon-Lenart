\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusions}
To sum everything up, learning about Computer Vision completely from scratch was very illuminating experience. I had to go through theory to practice to explore secrets of Machine Learning used in image processing. But hours spent on various courses won't go in vain. I am really found of continuing working on this or different subjects, because there is still plenty to do in this matter. Visual Bicycle Counter is only an introduction to development of traffic analysis or investments evaluation and planning and it always takes more time spent on developing it. Also different measures can be taken using gathered data, not only those from section \ref{sec:results}. Used model can also be trained to detect different types of objects like pedestrians, cars or electrical scooters, that are getting more and more popular nowadays. It may be used to evaluate investments not only on bike infrastructure but also roads or sidewalks. As Machine Learning techniques are developed, more and more ways they can be used and less human work it will require.

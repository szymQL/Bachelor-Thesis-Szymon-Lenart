\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusions}
To sum everything up, learning about Computer Vision entirely from scratch was a very illuminating experience. I had to go through theory to practice to explore the secrets of Machine Learning used in image processing. However, hours spent on various courses will not go in vain. I am working on this or different subjects because there is still plenty to do in this matter. Visual Bicycle Counter is only an introduction to traffic analysis or investments evaluation and planning, and it always takes more time spent on developing it. Different measures can also be taken using gathered data, not only those from chapter \ref{cha:results}. The used model can also be trained to detect different objects like pedestrians, cars or electric scooters, getting more and more popular nowadays. It may be used to evaluate investments not only on bike infrastructure but also roads or sidewalks. As Machine Learning techniques are developed, more and more ways can be used and less human work it will require. But in my opinion one thing will stay unchanged - the more data you have, the easier it is to work with Machine Learning algorithms overall and better the research results get.
